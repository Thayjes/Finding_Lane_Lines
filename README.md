# Finding_Lane_Lines
This is the first project in Term 1 of the Udacity Self Driving Car NanoDegree program.
The Ipython Notebook is my initial attempt at this project.

The aim of the project is to constantly identify the lane lines and draw line segments along these lanes in a video.
The output video are in the output_video file.

The writeup.md file contains a decription / reflection of the process I went through to design the code to accomplish the task.
